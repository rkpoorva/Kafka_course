Kafka Producer: Java API with keys

   Send messages with keys in kafka

   send non-null keys to the kafka topic

   same key = same partition

   key is id we define and data with same key will always go to the same partition

   key = truck_id ,
   truck_id_123 will always go to partition 0
   truck_id_345 will always go to partition 1

   send some keys with values (topic, key and value)

   we're going to produce multiple message with the same key and we'll see whether or not they end up in the same partition.

  ==>After running the code, we will see same key goes to same partition
